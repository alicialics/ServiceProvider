//Alicia, this is to show you that I am already a member on github. I don't know why it didn't show my email as registered. 
//I can contribute as well. I think it only showed you as a contributor because you're the only one (so far) that has contributed to it. 
//After posting this I'm expecting to be shown as a contributor as well.
//-Jenn
